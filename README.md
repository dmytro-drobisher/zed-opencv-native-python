# Stereolabs ZED -  OpenCV Native Capture in Python

This sample shows how to capture rectified images with the ZED (or ZED-M) Stereo Camera and OpenCV, without the ZED SDK, using only Python. It is insireped by the C++version of the same available from [stereolabs](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-opencv-native).

Alternatively, if you want to use OpenCV with the ZED SDK features, check our sample [here](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-opencv).

## Notes

- You need to know the serial number of the camera you are trying to open. To do so, you can use ZED Explorer tools (ZED SDK tools) and check the serial number on the top right of ZED Explorer window.
